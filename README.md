# AI Vision for Endoscopy

This repository contains python code that helps to partially automate analysis of gastrointestinal endoscopy images.  This software uses machine learning (neural networks for computer vision object detection) to analyze endoscopy images.  It classifies images as being "normal" or "abnormal" (that is, containing a gastrointestinal abnormality such as blood, a polyp, or a lesion).  (Later classifications: recognize the various kinds of abnormalities.  Later analysis: identify and highlight the location of the abnormality within the image.)
